    <p>
        MOCHCare is a health tech startup project with the passion for better health care for Mothers and Children seeking 
        to collect and store data of clients digitally and making it accessible anytime and anywhere. 
        We believe in making Maternal and Child Health Care Very Accessible, User Friendly and the centralization of Data.
        Over the past years, the Ghana Health Service has used series of maternal and child health record book to collect 
        and store data of their clients.        
    </p>
    <p>
        According to research, there hasn't been enough of these booklets which make health workers use exercise books or 
        photocopies of the booklet to attend to clients. Upon availability of the booklets, clients misplace or mishandle 
        the booklets and, in some instances, too, manipulate recorded information in the booklet.
        In a District assembly with a total of thirty-eight (38) health facilities, could be served seventy- five (75) 
        booklets for three (3) months.
    </p>
    <p>
        MOCHCare is here to digitize the Maternal and Child Health Record Book (MCH) to collect and store data. With this
        among others, Maternal Mortality rate will be drastically decreased for the system seeks to trace all defaulting 
        clients by means of automatic SMS/ VOICE CALL to remind clients of their due appointments with health workers. Death

    For decades, Africa has faced many endemic diseases: yellow fever, malaria, trypanosomiasis and infrastructure
    quality problems, lack of medical staff, difficulty in delivering drugs …. This affects considerably and sustainably
    the health of millions of Africans. Despite very encouraging growth, the African continent still faces the fragile
    health of the entire population. To overcome the inadequacy of health systems, more and more digital initiatives
    to fight against recurrent infections and diseases are gradually emerging. AfrikaTech’s goal is to highlight healthrelated
    initiatives in Africa. I want to bring together articles that open the mind to what tomorrow’s health
    system may be. The Africa of tomorrow is being built today, together.

    As a Health Tech company you must have heard of responsive website design. But why is it so important for your
    website to be responsive? Epocrates carried out a study by 1,063 physicians about their use of mobile devices at
    work. 86% answered they use smartphones in their professional activities while 53% use tablets at work. And that
    was only in 2013! Imagine how many customers you might lose today if your website doesn’t display well on
    every type of screen. Do the images on your website stay aligned when you look at it on a smartphone? Are all
    the navigation bars optimized so that it is easy to navigate on any device? Does the animated content display
    well on smaller screens?
    </p>
    <p>
    MOchCare is a user interface for doctors to centralize patients’ files and information. It’s also designed for
    doctors to access their patients’ information wherever they are. A good feature of this responsive website is the
    optimization of the content according to the size of the homepage. MocnCare’s designers understand the saying
    “a picture is worth a thousand words” and have applied it wisely. When you display the website on a smartphone,
    the pictures on the tablet get more space than the written content in the “doctors” section. A third good point:
    on a smartphone, the content is balanced so that users don’t have to endlessly scroll all the way down the
    homepage.
